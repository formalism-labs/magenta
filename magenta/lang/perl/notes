solution:
define a static member in Interpreter class that is to count active interpreters.
any time an interpreter is constructed or destructed, this member is increased or decreased, respectively.
in any interpreter-relevant mehtod, one checks the value of the counter member, and if it is positive, invokes
PERL_SET_CONTEXT() with the current interpreter (script) value.
